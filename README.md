# VRChatMixedOSC
DISCLAIMER: This project is a heavily modified (rewrite) of cyberkitsune's [vrc-osc-scripts](https://github.com/cyberkitsune/vrc-osc-scripts) repository. This project wouldn't be possible without their original code. Absolutely ALL credit goes to them. Also note that any up-to-date installation on this repository is necessary for this to work in your own fork of this, if you feel that you wish to edit/use this yourself, make sure to follow the set-up instructions that the original creator has provided.

Heads up! I provided a VRChat Sub Menu & Parameters for you to attach the controls to your own avatar and control which OSC Output is active at a time. Just download the UnityPackage and import it into your own project :D

<br>
There are some personal things in here, such as a little token to my boyfriend ("My Eggy"), if you don't wanna see this, feel free to change it to your own comment. As well as a Unity Project Status. If you know what you're doing, you can change this as you wish to something else you want people to know about. Additionally, I have removed **ALL** translation components, as at the time of making this, I had zero personal use for this. I might add it back in later (it'd be some basic ass copy and paste since the OG worked great).
