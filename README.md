# VRChatMixedOSC
DISCLAIMER: This project is a heavily modified (rewrite) of cyberkitsune's [vrc-osc-scripts](https://github.com/cyberkitsune/vrc-osc-scripts) repository. This project wouldn't be possible without their original code. Absolutely ALL credit goes to them. Also note that any up-to-date installation on this repository is necessary for this to work in your own fork of this, if you feel that you wish to edit/use this yourself, make sure to follow the set-up instructions that the original creator has provided.

Heads up! I provided a VRChat Sub Menu & Parameters for you to attach the controls to your own avatar and control which OSC Output is active at a time. Just download the UnityPackage and import it into your own project :D
<br>
<br>
<br>
There are some personal things in here, such as a little token to my VRChat group 'Player Killers' (not a gang monkey group), keep it, or edit it from the config.yml under the 'SubText' key. As well as a Unity Project Status, make sure to open your project via vrchat creator companion, otherwise it will show an error (but I made even that look pretty!). If you know what you're doing, you can change this as you wish to something else you want people to know about. Additionally, I have removed **ALL** translation components, as at the time of making this, I had zero personal use for this. I might add it back in later (it'd be some basic ass copy and paste since the OG worked great), note that all Speech to Text OSC has been disabled in this version due to network traffic clogging causing extreme ping issues (someone hit 2.5 million ping because of it).
